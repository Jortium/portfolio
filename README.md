# portfolio

My first protfolio website! Here you'll find more information on me the projects I have done as well as contact information to reach out to me. To build this webpage I used JQuery to make some transitions smoother. 

My most challengeing hurdle of making this project had to be the CSS. Making the CSS just right so things function well and smoothly was a big hurdle.

Feel free to reach out to me with comments concerns or feedback for this!
